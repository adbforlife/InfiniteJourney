All I can tell you is that you are on the right path, and there is a long way ahead of you.", "Old man 2: I didn't expect you to be this consistent. Alright, considering you are determined, I will tell you this much: you will see 9 of me before you reach your destination. You have seen 2 so far. Good luck!", "Old man 3: I heard your wife and three children were killed during a bandit raid on their cattle ranching town on the frontier. What a tragedy... I promise you will find what you need at the Dangajee River.", "Old man 4: I hope you didn't sit down in that burned-down church "]
